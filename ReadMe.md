# Daily GIFS

## Purpose

Initially wanted to send cat gifs to my friends but simply generalized the project to send any gif based off input. 

## Motivation

Curious on sending messages to friends using python and try to communicate with a simple API with JSON data format

## Usage

Just run python script with facebook login authentication and modify gif search parameters through command line input. You can set up a cronjob to send these periodically.
